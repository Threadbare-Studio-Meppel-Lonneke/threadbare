"Here, you discovered the Bougainvillea, a vine with bright, paper-like leaves. You named it for our captain, Bougainville himself.
This plant, like you, hides its true strength behind a disguise. At first it looks delicate, but it is hardy, able to climb and survive in the toughest places. Remember this Jeanne, sometimes, what looks fragile is stronger than anyone believes."
